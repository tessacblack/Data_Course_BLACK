Assignment 8 TCB

1. Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain.
 	A lot of the pairwise comparisons in mod5 are insignificant according to a p value of 0.05
	There were four significant interactions and several near-significant interactions. 

2. In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships? Do a bit of research online and give a link to at least one resource explaining how to deal with modeling non-linear relationships in R.
	My prediction plot looks like it's exponential.

# 3. Write the code you would use to model the data found in “/Data/non_linear_relationship.csv” #  with a linear model (there are a few ways of doing this)
nonlinear <- read_csv("./non_linear_relationship.csv")

# Transform data
transformed_nonlinear <- nonlinear %>%
  filter(rowSums(. != 0) == ncol(.))
transformed_nonlinear <- na.omit(transformed_nonlinear)
nonlinear_model <- lm(data = transformed_nonlinear, formula = response ~ predictor) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = predictor, y = response))+
  geom_point()
print(nonlinear_model)

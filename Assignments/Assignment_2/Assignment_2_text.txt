###### Assignment 2 ########Task 4: Find the csv files and save as objectcsv_files <- list.files(path = "Data", pattern = ".csv", recursive = TRUE)#Task 5: Find how many files match that description using the length() functionlength(csv_files)y <- length(csv_files)#Task 6: Open the wingspan_vs_mass.csv file and store the contents as an R object named “df” using the read.csv() functiondf <- read.csv(list.files(pattern = "wingspan_vs_mass.csv", recursive = TRUE))#Task 7: Inspect the first 5 lines of this data set using the head() functionhead(df,n=5)#Task 8: Find any files (recursively) in the Data/ directory that begin with the letter “b” (lowercase)list.files(path = "Data", pattern = "^b",recursive = TRUE)#Task 9: Write a command that displays the first line of each of those “b” files (this is tricky… use a for-loop)    #make variable for bfilesbfiles <- list.files(path = "Data", pattern = "^b",recursive = TRUE,full.names = TRUE)    #for-loopfor(i in bfiles){  print(readLines(i, n=1))}#Task 10: Do the same thing for all files that end in “.csv”    #make variabletask10 <- list.files(path = "Data", pattern = "*.csv",recursive = TRUE,full.names = TRUE)    #for-loopfor(i in task10){  print(readLines(i, n=1))}

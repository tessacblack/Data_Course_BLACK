For my final project, I plan to use the data I've collected during my research project with Dr. Cusick.
This project investigated how maternal environment (e.g. stress, microbiome manipulations) affects offspring behavior. More specifically, I looked at whether or not the offspring were consistent in their behavioral responses to a 15 minute social stressor. 
I have 10 minutes of behavioral data on 25 hamsters. The offspring were subjected to a 15 minute resident-intruder trial. I'm comparing their behaviors in the first five minutes of the trial to their behavior in the last 5 minutes of the trial, to see if they are consistent throughout the course of the stressor (spoiler alert: they aren't).
This data has already been analyzed by Dr. Cusick. We are currently writing up a paper for publication. However, I wasn't involved in the data analysis since I had a limited understanding of coding and data analysis before this class. 
I will be learning how to run the analyses that we are including in our paper, namely principle component analyses and pariwise comparisons of various treatments. 
As stated above, I have data on 25 hamsters, and the data is divided up by first five minutes of trial and last five minutes of trial (total 50 lines of data). This data has multiple fixed effects and random effects, and there are 4 different treatments which are the independent variables. For each behavior, I will be analyzing both number of occurrences for that behavior and total duration of the behavior.

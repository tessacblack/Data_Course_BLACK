# I. Read the cleaned_covid_data.csv file into an R data frame. (20 pts)
df <- read_csv("./data/cleaned_covid_data.csv")



# II. Subset the data set to just show states that begin with “A” and save this as an object called A_states. (20 pts)
# 
# Use the tidyverse suite of packages
# Selecting rows where the state starts with “A” is tricky (you can use the grepl() function or just a vector of those states if you prefer)
# III. Create a plot of that subset showing Deaths over time, with a separate facet for each state. (20 pts)
# 
# Create a scatterplot
# Add loess curves WITHOUT standard error shading
# Keep scales “free” in each facet
# IV. (Back to the full dataset) Find the “peak” of Case_Fatality_Ratio for each state and save this as a new data frame object called state_max_fatality_rate. (20 pts)
# 
# I’m looking for a new data frame with 2 columns:
#   
#   “Province_State”
# “Maximum_Fatality_Ratio”
# Arrange the new data frame in descending order by Maximum_Fatality_Ratio
# This might take a few steps. Be careful about how you deal with missing values!
#   
#   V. Use that new data frame from task IV to create another plot. (20 pts)
# 
# X-axis is Province_State
# Y-axis is Maximum_Fatality_Ratio
# bar plot
# x-axis arranged in descending order, just like the data frame (make it a factor to accomplish this)
# X-axis labels turned to 90 deg to be readable
# Even with this partial data set (not current), you should be able to see that (within these dates), different states had very different fatality ratios.
# 
# VI. (BONUS 10 pts) Using the FULL data set, plot cumulative deaths for the entire US over time
# 
# You’ll need to read ahead a bit and use the dplyr package functions group_by() and summarize() to accomplish this.
